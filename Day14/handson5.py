"""File locking is a mechanism that restricts access to a computer file, or to a region of a file, by allowing only one 
user or process to modify or delete it in a specific time and to prevent reading of the file while 
it's being modified or deleted. It can be used in scenarios where an API only allows one access_key 
generation. This creates race condition when multiple processes try to generate access_key and only 
one process which finishes last has the valid access_key and all other fails the subsequent calls to the API.
The problem statement is: Implement file lock using context manager.

The file lock class should allow following syntax and when ran simultaneously on two processes, it should raise error.
